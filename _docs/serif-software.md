## Overview

I’m perhaps the Fuchsia Team member with the shortest relevant work history.  I’m a newcomer to the world of graphic design, having spent most of my life working in the aerospace electronics and gaming industries, which both demand precise adherence to rules and proper work procedures.  So when I decided I wanted to be a graphic designer, I did some research and I chose Serif Software for my design work.  Serif Software is published in England and provides comprehensive and extremely capable suites of apps that include design, photo and publishing programs at prices, and with upgrade policies, far better than Adobe software.
I originally used Serif DrawPlus, PhotoPlus and PagePlus on my Windows PC and then Serif introduced the award winning Affinity line of design apps: Affinity Designer, Affinity Photo and Affinity Publisher.  Affinity was originally introduced for use on Macs and iPads and then Serif expanded Affinity to include apps for Windows (all file format outputs are interchangeable).  
I find that there are some features of the older Plus line that I prefer and many features of the Affinity line that I prefer.  In the course of my design work, I’m even able to use a mixture of the older legacy Plus apps and the newer Affinity apps.  In addition, the Affinity apps can all seamlessly switch from one to the other, so that the different functions are ALL available when working on any design without any interruption in work flow.
These excellent apps let me choose the projects I apply for, with a degree of confidence that is very reassuring.  Since I’m not an expert, I seek to expand my capabilities in a controlled and thoughtful way, so I can learn and yet not get “in over my head”.  The point is, I want to learn, but never fail to give my clients all they deserve and ask for.  And from the reviews I have read, the learning curve with Serif Software is not as steep as with Adobe.  That’s a plus for this old guy!
