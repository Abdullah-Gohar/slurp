First up, if you would like to add to this documentation, GitHub uses [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown)
and here's a great 3 minute [GitHub guide](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown) on mastering markdown.
The best practice way to add to this documentation is to [fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo) and create
a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request). The easiest way to start using GitHub is to
use [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com).
